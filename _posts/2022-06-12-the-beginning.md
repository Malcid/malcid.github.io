Yesterday, someone said to me, that not the beginning is the hardest part of a project. It's the Perseverance. Yes, he is totally right.
The Staying Power, the endurance, the stamina to work on that project in your free-time. That you are on track even when things are getting hard. In our everyday-jobs, it's the money that can motivate me during bad days. But in the projects in our free time. What keep us motivated there?

At first, it's the fun. 
Man, I love playing computer games, since I'm a kid. To create my own one is a dream and thought which has matured in my head for many years. But if you want to create your own games. Indie-like on your own or with some friends. Then you have to fill many roles in the process. 

At first, you have to be a Game designer. That person with the initial's idea of the game, that person which answers many  game design choices like, which game engine to use, or how the in-game fights logic works, and so on.

The creative Game artist, which creates assets, like 3D-character or objects in the environment, sound effects, animations and so on for your game.

The game programmer who hacks the ideas into his computer and creates executable code, which ends up being the files on the pc that make up the game.

These three roles scratch only the surface of the jobs in the game industry. You have for example: The Database engineer, voice actor, marketing manager, UI Developer... (You can have a quick look on the Hitmarker Gaming professions overview: [Hitmarker Gaming Professions](https://hitmarker.net/career-advice/the-complete-list-of-gaming-esports-jobs))

A bit overwhelming?

Yes, a little. But this is a hobby project. I'm not a professional game developer, and I probably won't be in the future either. So keep it simple and easy, Malcid. Plus, it can be super fun to dive into all of these roles.

Okay, but not everything will be fun. There are some things in every work, which are not quite fun. Things that you have to do. Some things have to be learned, and many things will not be easy to do by yourself. Sometimes the results will not be as you would like them to be. And then you sit on a problem for weeks and see no progress.

And that's where this blog comes in. I would like to record my progress here. Even if there is no visible progress, every problem that is solved in the development is also progress.
You, the reader, may be able to take something away from this. You don't have to make the same mistakes again. Furthermore, you can follow how the project is going and give your input. But also for me it is important to see the progress and to hear your opinion. If there is also something to show, I can also imagine to make short and sweet videos.

I'm excited to see what the blog will look like in the future. It is quite clear that I will not fill the blog with content every day. Otherwise I won't get anything done besides my full-time job and social life. Especially not to develop games :D.
And while we're on the subject of the game. Maybe I should tell you a little bit about the game, which should be there at the end of my very first trip.

I am a  DayZ player. For me, there is no survival game in my already somewhat longer gaming life that offers such player interaction. On each run, you meet different people, have different conversations, find different things, and yes, you die in different ways. This provides an incredibly high replay value. This is despite the engine being more than outdated, the game still has a large player base. For me, it is a great game and a superb time killer. Enough raving, just check out one of the two streamers [BenFruit](www.twitch.tv/benfruit) or [Ceremor](www.twitch.tv/ceremor) on Twitch to get an idea of what it's like.

I think this player interaction can be a great component in other games as well. For example, in a dungeon crawler in a medieval Tarkov-style. Again, I'm bringing another game into the fold. Escape from Tarkov is a shooter MMO that has similarities with DayZ [(Tarkov on Twitch)](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Escape%20from%20Tarkov). Unlike the survival competitor, however, you don't play in a persistent world, but instead go with your character into instanced raids. In the raids, you search for new weapons and equipment before making our way out through an exit. To make sure this doesn't get too boring, AI opponents and other players populate the world. Similar to DayZ, you can ally with other players, but also fight each other at any time. When you die, you lose all the equipment you have with you.

Among them are already some aspects in my game idea that are overkill for a beginner developer: Multiplayer, Voice Chat, Large Maps, Loot System, possibly an RPG System, some kind of Player Housing, not to mention tons of self-made Game Assets.
Let's be honest here. This is almost impossible for a complete noob like me to do in my spare time without any real prior experience. In the first Untiy tutorials you learn that as a noob you should take your idea, remove half of the features, then do that again and maybe again and that's where you should start.

Yep, they're absolutely right about that. That's what I'm going to do. For now, I'll let a player run around that I've modeled myself. Then it will interact with the environment in some way. Be it an opponent or any other object. Maybe the next step would be a small....

Stop, I think this could be another blog post. What I want to say is that I want to get closer to my goal in small steps. Maybe parts of the goals will change, but fuck it. The main thing is that I, and maybe you, have fun to follow me on this path. 

So what happens next?
In the last few months I've been working a bit with [Unity](https://unity.com/), a game engine, Blender, a program for modeling, but also generally with the development of games in my spare time, of course.
Since I am a huge fan of free open source software. And by that I mean free as in free beer, as is the case with the Godot Game Engine. Would I like to familiarize with the games engine [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). There I will bring my first models to life and take the first steps to fulfill my little sweet childhood dream to develop my own game.

Thank you very much if you as readers have already made it this far.
