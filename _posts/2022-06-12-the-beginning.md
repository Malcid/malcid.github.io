Yesterday, someone said to me, that not the beginning is the hardest part of a project. It's the Perseverance. Yes, he is totally right.
The Staying Power, the endurance, the stamina to work on that project in your free-time. That you are on track even when things are getting hard. In our everyday-jobs, it's the money that can motivate us during bad days. But in the projects in our free time. What keep us motivated there?

At first, it's the fun. 
Man, I love playing computer games, since I'm a kid. To create my own one is a dream and thought which has matured in my head for many years. But if you want to create your own games. Indie-like on your own or with some friends. Then you have to fill many roles in the process. 

At first, you have to be a Game designer. That person with the initial's idea of the game, that person which answers many  game design choices like, which game engine to use, or how the in-game fights logic works, and so on.

The creative Game artist, which creates assets, like 3D-character or objects in the environment, sound effects, animations and so on for your game.

The game programmer who hacks the ideas into his computer and creates executable code, which ends up being the files on the pc that make up the game.

These three roles scratch only the surface of the jobs in the game industry. You have for example: The Database engineer, voice actor, marketing manager, UI Developer...

A bit overwhelming?

Yes, a bit. But this is a hobby project. I'm not a professional game developer, and i probably won't be in the future either. So keep it simple and easy, Malcid. Plus, it can be super fun to dive into all of these roles.

Okay, but not everything will be funny. There are some things in every work, which are not quite fun. Things that you have to do. Some things have to be learned, and many things will not be easy to do by yourself. Sometimes the results will not be as you would like them to be. And then you sit on a problem for weeks and see no progress.

And that's where this blog comes in. I would like to record my progress here. Even if there is no visible progress, every problem that is solved in the development is also progress.
You, the reader, may be able to take something away from this. You don't have to make the same mistakes again. Furthermore, you can follow how the project is going and give your input. But also for me it is important to see the progress and to hear your opinion. If there is also something to show, I can also imagine to make short and sweet videos.

I'm excited to see what the blog will look like in the future.
